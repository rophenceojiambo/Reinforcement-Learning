# Final Project for PHP 2650

## Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading

This repository holds files related to the final project in PHP 2650 Statistical Learning and Big Data, Spring 2023, School of Public Health, Brown University. This project explores the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for making trading decisions in the stock market. Specifically, we implemented Q-learning and SARSA algorithms in R and a deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm in Python to develop trading strategies based on historical stock data.

On our GitHub page, the website provides an introduction to reinforcement learning and explains how it can be used to develop trading strategies. The website then delves into the various reinforcement learning algorithms that can be used for stock trading, and provides an overview of previous work in this area. Finally, the website discusses the specific application of reinforcement learning to stock data and the potential benefits of using this approach in trading. Overall, the website serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about how reinforcement learning can be used to develop effective trading strategies in the stock market.

## Repository Organization 

- `Data Analysis`: This folder contains our Reinforcement Learning algorithms implemented in this project, specifically `Q-Learning`, `SARSA` and `DQN`.

- `Data`: This folder contains the data sets used for the stocks. The quantmod package was used to retrieve the stock price data from Yahoo Finance. We collect data from four stocks (Apple, Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, Netflix) from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2022. 

- `Figures`: This folder contains figures used in this project. GIFs, Pseudo codes, equations, and plots for the implementation of the RL algorithms are included.

- `Literature Review`: This folder contains some of the main papers and resources used for literature review.

- `references.bib` & `apa-numeric-superscript-brackets.csl`: This file contains the references used in this project.
